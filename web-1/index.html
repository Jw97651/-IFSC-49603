            <p>
                The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity.
                Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message
                is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data.
            </p>

            <p class="alert">
                This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not
                be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does.
            </p>

            <p>
                Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to
                accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather
                than the illumination of it.

        <section id="questions">
            <h2>Questions</h2>

            <p>Please answer the following questions below. Remember to mark up the information properly using HTML.</p>

            <!-- Question 1 -->
            <p class="q">
                <strong>Explain the difference between the "alt" attribute and the "title" attribute.</strong><br>
                <span class="ans">
                    The alt attribute provides descriptive text for an image if it cannot be displayed and is used by
                    screen readers for accessibility purposes.<br>
                    The title attribute provides additional information that appears as a tooltip when a user hovers
                    over an element with a mouse, but it is not reliable for accessibility.
                </span>
            </p>

            <!-- Question 2 -->
            <p class="q">
                <strong>Please provide an example of how to mark up a definition from the dictionary below</strong><br>
            </p>

            <dl class="ans">
                <dt><dfn>header</dfn></dt>
                <dd>
                    In HTML, the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> element defines the introductory content of a document
                    or a section. This tag typically contains headings, introductory text, navigation links,
                    and sometimes logos.
                </dd>
            </dl>

            <!-- Question 3 -->
            <p class="q">
                <strong>Provide an example of link pointing to your favorite site</strong><br>
                <span class="ans">
                    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">My favorite site</a>
